Identifying the Features:Easily Accessible,Intuitive for the pupil,Calculations to convert from grade to percent are in built with visibility,Easy sorting out by providing filters.
State of Art:"Academic report  generator for pupil"is an application used to convey the performance of pupil who are pursuing their degrees in different institutions with in their finger tips by acquiring and gaining the knowledge of utilising the technology.No need to search for their results in the newspapers like earlier days and also we can store the data permanantly for longer days for our reference.
Approach:4W AND 1H  1)WHAT:Inorder to generate the academic report of the student at their finger tips so that they can easily access their result at any time and will be aware of their performance.2)WHY:In this present generation, the technology plays an important role for making the humans life easier,but as we saw in our olden days they witnessed their result in news paper and some times they need to travel to see this. To over come these situations we coming this project.3)WHEN:We can access into the app at any time with the provided credentials as key once institution uploads the results.4)WHERE:Most of the educational institutions need this app because with this they can create an awareness among the students over their performances and also it is very secure others cannot access into other accounts and maniplate their result.1)HOW:With c programming language we can provide a flexible code to develop the application and also provude intuitive service to the students and also staff.
SWOT ANALYSIS:STRENGTH: The strength of our project is the flexible code and its security by not making unauthorised people to access it.WEAKNESS:Most of the colleges has their own websites to provide such facility ,i need to prove my project is better by making aware of the advantages.OPPORTUNITY:Firstly i want to prove my self by starting with people who goes for tuitions and by that i can implement it largely by creating my own opportunity through them
HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:Student id,Student id,Subjects according to semester wise,Percentage conversion formula,Grading formula .
LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS :calculator,notes,timing conventions.
